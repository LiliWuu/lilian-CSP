# Setting Up Tools and Equipment 🛠️

## Operating System Setup 💻
1. **Install Essential Tools**: Download and install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (package manager for macOS) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (code editor)

2. **Run Setup Scripts** 📝: These scripts configure your development environment by installing necessary dependencies, setting up Git with your credentials, and creating a Python virtual environment
   
   **(macOS)**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/activate_macos.sh
   ./scripts/activate.sh # prompts for Git UID and Personal Email
   ./scripts/venv.sh
   ```

3. **Verify Installation** ✅: Check that all tools are properly installed with correct versions
   ```bash
   python --version    # Shows Python version
   pip --version       # Shows pip (Python package installer) version
   ruby -v            # Shows Ruby version
   bundle -v          # Shows Bundler (Ruby dependency manager) version
   gem --version      # Shows RubyGems version
   git config --global --list  # Lists your Git configuration settings
   ```

## VSCode Configuration 🔧

### Project Creation and Access 🚀
1. **Find Your Repository**: Navigate to your repository on GitHub (e.g., https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/pages) and copy the web URL

2. **Clone Repository**: Open terminal and run these commands to clone your repository:
   ```bash
   cd                    # Move to your home directory
   mkdir -p YOUR-ORG     # Create directory for your organization (replace YOUR-ORG)
   cd YOUR-ORG          # Navigate to your organization directory (replace YOUR-ORG)
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/student.git  # Clone your repository (replace YOUR-ORG)
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment**: Configure virtual environment and open project in VSCode
   ```bash
   cd student                    # Move to your personal project directory
   ./scripts/venv.sh            # Create and activate virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate     # Activate virtual environment (you'll see (venv) in prompt)
   bundle install               # Install Ruby gems for GitHub Pages in virtual environment
   code .                       # Open the project in VS Code
   ```

4. **Start Local Server** 🌐: Run your Jekyll site locally for development and testing
   ```bash
   make                         # Builds and serves the Jekyll site locally
   ```

## Version Control and Management 🔄

### GitHub Features 🐙
GitHub serves as your remote repository and collaboration platform. Key features include:

- **Repositories** 📁: Store your project code and track changes over time
- **Branches** 🌿: Create separate lines of development for features or experiments
- **Forks** 🍴: Create personal copies of other people's repositories to contribute
- **Issues** 🐛: Track bugs, feature requests, and project tasks
- **Kanban Boards** 📋: Organize and prioritize work using project management boards
- **GitHub Pages** 🌍: Deploy your website directly from your repository
- **Actions** ⚡: Automate workflows like testing and deployment when code changes

### VSCode Version Control 🎛️
VSCode provides integrated Git functionality through its Source Control panel:

- **Commits** 💾: Save snapshots of your changes with descriptive messages
  ```bash
  git add .                    # Stage all changes
  git commit -m "Your message" # Commit changes with message
  ```
- **Push/Pull** ⬆️⬇️: Sync changes between local and remote repositories
  ```bash
  git push origin main         # Upload local changes to remote
  git pull origin main         # Download remote changes to local
  ```
- **Branches** 🔀: Create and switch between different development branches
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature-name # Create and switch to new branch
  git checkout main           # Switch back to main branch
  ```
- **Merge Conflicts** ⚔️: Resolve conflicts when multiple people edit the same code
- **Staging** 📝: Select which changes to include in your next commit
- **History** 📜: View commit history and compare different versions

## Essential Commands 💻

### Basic Shell Commands 🐚
These fundamental terminal commands help you navigate and manage files:

```bash
ls        # List files and directories in current location
pwd       # Print working directory (show current location)
mkdir     # Make/create new directories
cd        # Change directory (navigate between folders)
git       # Version control system for tracking code changes
cat       # Display contents of files in terminal
```

### Helpful Tips & Tricks 💡

- **Multi-Repository Workspace** 🗂️: If you can't drag and drop files between repositories in VSCode, open multiple repositories in one workspace:
  ```bash
  code YOUR-ORG/student YOUR-ORG/pages  # Replace YOUR-ORG with your organization name
  # Note: Adjust the path according to your actual directory structure
  ```
  This opens both the student and pages repositories in the same VSCode workspace for easier file management.

- **Check Git Configuration** ⚙️: View your repository's Git settings:
  ```bash
  cat .git/config  # 'cat' displays the contents of the Git config file
  ```
  This shows your remote URLs, branch tracking, and other repository-specific Git settings.

# Progress & Reflections 📈

Coming into CSP with prior experience from CSSE and CSA, most of my development tools were already installed, which made the initial setup relatively smooth. However, I did encounter some outdated software that required updates to function properly with the current workflow.

## Key Learning Experiences 🎓

**New Command-Line Skills**: This unit introduced me to several useful terminal commands I hadn't used before:
- `code ~` - Opens VSCode in the home directory
- `code YOUR-ORG/student YOUR-ORG/pages` - Opens multiple repositories in one workspace
- `cat .git/config` - Displays Git configuration settings
- Virtual environment setup procedures using `./scripts/venv.sh`

**Peer Teaching Benefits**: One of the most valuable aspects was helping classmates troubleshoot their setup issues. Explaining concepts and walking through solutions with others actually strengthened my own understanding of the tools and processes.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions ⚙️

### Jupyter Notebook Integration 📝
Getting comfortable with Jupyter notebooks involved learning to:
- Execute code cells through Help → Toggle Developer Tools → Console
- Create DOM elements for displaying output using `%%html` magic commands
- Implement JavaScript functionality within notebook cells for interactive content

Here's an example of embedding interactive JavaScript in a Jupyter cell:
```html
%%html
<div id="joke-out" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 8px 0;"></div>
<script>
  // JavaScript code for displaying random programming jokes
</script>
```

### Repository Management Insights 🗂️
**GitHub Organizations vs. Public Repos**: I initially thought creating a public repository would be sufficient for team collaboration. However, I discovered that simply making a repo public doesn't automatically grant collaborators access to important features like:
- Issues tracking
- Project kanban boards  
- Advanced repository settings

**Solution**: Created a GitHub organization, which properly enabled all collaborative features for team members.

### Theme Customization 🎨
**Discovery**: Used `make help` in the pages repository to explore available customization options
**Process**: Theme changes automatically updated multiple files:
- Gemfile (Ruby dependencies)
- _config.yml (Jekyll configuration)  
- post.html (template files)
