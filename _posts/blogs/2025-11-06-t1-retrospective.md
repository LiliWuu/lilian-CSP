# Self-Reflection
- Better at organizing a team
- Improved communication
- Learned how to accomodate for differences

# Key Moments from Sprints
## Tools
- Helping others with setting up clarified the procedures for me
- Learning how to structure pages through Sci-Fi Tools lesson (quiz-like progression through pages)

## Fundamentals of JS/Python
- Clarified concepts I didn't understand (algorithmic efficiency)
- Sending requests and testing in a Flask server (calling procedures lab)
- Involving all team members in planning and executing the project (whiteboard planning)

## Digital Famine
- Implementing Gemini API and getting it to work
- Going more in depth on the API layers (microblog api)

# N@TM
- Received all positive comments
- Visited CSSE game
    - Cohesive theme and well-integrated levels
    - Interesting storyline, fluid gameplay, seems not buggy
    - Casino level: well-executed game, could be improved by adding a tutorial/instructions on black jack

# Looking Ahead
## Digital Famine 
If given time, I would revise the submodules to be more cohesive with the digital famine concept (adding digital famine storyline in the lesson, adding a figure who narrates according to the digital famine, adding features that relate to other submodules, more cohesive theme for each submodule)

## CS Learning
- Creating projects in subject areas of digital famine (microblogging, AI/ML, cybersecurity)
    - e.g developing image processing system, designing system to detect phishing websites
- Learn core concepts like algorithms, data structures, data management through group projects 
- Mock hackathons? 
    - Form teams, solve a challenge, present project at the end

# MCQ Review
[College Board MCQ Results](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/103/assessments/results/71349601/performance)
- Approach: Do all the questions without using outside sources, with no timing constraints. I guessed on questions I don't know.

## Correction

| **Topic** | **Question** | **Correction** |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **3.5 Boolean Expressions** | <img src="../../images/3.5.png" width="250"><br> | Not (Not P) AND (NOT Q) because the second condition isn’t satisfied when P or Q differ. I read the question wrong. |
| **3.6 Conditionals** | <img src="../../images/3.6.png" width="250"><br> | Option C is wrong because the robot moves back and forth in the first two blocks. Option A is correct because it checks if it can move right first, allowing the robot to enter a loop with the gray box. |
| **3.13 Developing Procedures** | <img src="../../images/3.13.png" width="250"><br> | Misinterpreted “documentation.” Documentation refers to non-code elements, so it doesn’t affect algorithmic complexity. |
| **3.17 Algorithmic Efficiency** | <img src="../../images/3.17.png" width="250"><br> | A polynomial number of steps means the algorithm runs in a reasonable time (per the College Board). |
| **4.1 The Internet** | <img src="../../images/4.1.png" width="250"><br> | Open standards and protocols are public specifications that enable interoperability, but they do **not** permit copyrighted material sharing. |
| **4.2 Fault Tolerance** | <img src="../../images/4.2.png" width="250"><br> | Misread the question — it asks which setup **doesn’t have** a path between P and S, not which setup doesn’t allow one to be created. |
| **5.1 Beneficial & Harmful Effects** | <img src="../../images/5.1.png" width="250"><br> | Cloud computing uses remote servers for data storage/processing. Redundant routing ensures connectivity if a main path fails. Cloud services must consider user data security — so Option C. |
| **5.4 Crowdsourcing** | <img src="../../images/5.4.png" width="250"><br> | Citizen science involves public collaboration with scientists. Large-scale experiments at different locations require multiple participants — Option C. |
| **5.6 Safe Computing** | <img src="../../images/5.6.png" width="250"><br> | In public-key cryptography, messages are encrypted using a recipient’s **public key** and decrypted with their **private key**. |

# Something Cool To Share
Not yet, I'm planning on doing more personal projects starting now.
